```

This report documents my first attempts of using GitHub to version control an RStudio project. I will be modifying this report, staging and commiting
changes and then pushing to GitHub.  

Let's create a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mpg).  

```{r, test-plot}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance (miles)")
```
A summary of the data frame is given below  
```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
