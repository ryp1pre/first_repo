This report documents my first attempts of using GitHub to version control an RStudio project. I will be modifying this report, staging and commiting
changes and then pushing to GitHub.  

Let's create a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mpg).  

```{r, test-plot}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance (miles)")
```
A summary of the data frame is given below  
```{r, cars-summary}
kable(summary(cars))
```

```{r, ggplot}
cars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(speed, dist)) +
   geom_point(color ="steelblue", pch = 16, size = 2) +
   theme_bw()
```
